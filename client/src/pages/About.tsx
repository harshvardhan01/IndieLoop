						Our Story
					</h2>
					<div className="prose prose-lg text-gray-700">
						<p className="mb-4">
							IndieLoop was born from a simple belief: that
							authentic, handcrafted goods tell stories that
							mass-produced items never could. Every wooden bowl
							carries the grain of its tree and the hands that
							shaped it. Every textile weaves together tradition,
							skill, and the artist's vision.
						</p>
						<p className="mb-4">
							We work directly with artisans from multiple
							countries, ensuring they receive fair compensation
							for their incredible skills. Our platform bridges
							the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern
							consumers who value authenticity and quality.
						</p>
						<p>
							When you shop with IndieLoop, you're not just buying
							a product â€“ you're supporting a craftsperson,
							preserving a tradition, and bringing a piece of
							authentic artistry into your life.
